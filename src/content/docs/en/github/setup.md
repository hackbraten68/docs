To work with Git, you will need to install the necessary tools on your local machine.

## Installing Git

### MacOS
1. Open Terminal.
2. Install Git by running the following command:

   ```bash
   brew install git
If you donâ€™t have Homebrew installed, you can install it from here.

### Windows
1. Download the Git installer from Git for Windows.
2. Follow the installation wizard with the default options.

### Linux
1. Open Terminal.
2. Install Git using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install git
```
(This is for Debian-based systems, like Ubuntu. For other Linux distros, use the corresponding package manager.)

Once installed, confirm the installation by running:

```bash
git --version
```
You should see the installed version of Git displayed.

GitHub Desktop (Optional)
If you prefer a graphical interface for Git, you can use GitHub Desktop. Download and install it for your operating system, then follow the instructions to sign in with your GitHub account.
